I set up a database with Supabase and connected it to my server.js.
I used port 8080 and tried the try and catch method for error handling, but I couldn't quite figure out how to log the errors to the console.

I also forgot to add my node_modules and .env to my .gitignore, and they were pushed to GitHub. Being the "smart cookie" I am, I deleted the files on GitHub but forgot that I needed to pull the changes to avoid losing the files. After some trial and error, I managed to restore everything and test both the server and the client to make sure they were still working. :D
Still haven't figured out how to get rid of the files from history if I ever do that again.
